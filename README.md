# WORMY!

This project is a Python-based application that includes two classes: `ScoringSystem` and `Worm`. 

## ScoringSystem

The `ScoringSystem` class is designed to keep track of a user's score. It has two methods:

- `correct_answer()`: This method increases the score by 1 each time it is called.
- `get_score()`: This method returns the current score.

## Worm

The `Worm` class simulates a worm moving in a 2D space. It has four methods:

- `move_up()`: This method moves the worm up by one unit.
- `move_down()`: This method moves the worm down by one unit.
- `move_left()`: This method moves the worm left by one unit.
- `move_right()`: This method moves the worm right by one unit.

## Testing

The project includes unit tests for both classes using Python's built-in `unittest` module. The tests ensure that the methods in both classes are working as expected.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then clone the repository and run the Python files.

## Usage

To use the `ScoringSystem` class, create an instance of the class and call the `correct_answer()` method to increase the score. You can then call the `get_score()` method to get the current score.

To use the `Worm` class, create an instance of the class and call the `move_up()`, `move_down()`, `move_left()`, or `move_right()` methods to move the worm in the respective direction.
